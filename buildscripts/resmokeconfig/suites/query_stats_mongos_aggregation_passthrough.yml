  This suite enables the collection of query stats metrics on a mongos server, then runs the tests in
  core and aggregation as normal. This should cause each aggregation to compute a query
  shape and query stats key, and record in-memory some metrics like execution time and number of
  scanned documents. Then it uses the 'RunQueryStats' hook to collect the query stats at the end of
  each test, once with HMAC application enabled and once without. It doesn't assert anything about
  the collected query stats, it is just meant to make sure nothing is going seriously awry (e.g.
  crashing).

  # SERVER-94231 These tests are excluded because query stats changes the error code that
  # certain queries return. Specifically, queries that a) end in error and b) pass through
  # mongos end up erroring in the query stats makeKey() callback. Query stats propagates the
  # error with a different code, which makes the test fail. This behavior only exists pre-8.0,
  # so we don't care to address this more robustly.
