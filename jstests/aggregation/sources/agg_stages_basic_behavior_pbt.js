/**
 * Test basic properties that should hold for our core agg stages, when placed at the end of a
 * pipeline. This includes:
 *  - An exclusion projection should drop the specified fields.
 *  - An inclusion projection should keep the specified fields, and drop all others.
 *  - $limit should limit the number of results.
 *  - $sort should output documents in sorted order.
 *  - $group should output documents with unique _ids (the group key).
 *
 * These may seem like simple checks that aren't worth testing. However with complex optimizations,
 * they may break sometimes, such as with SERVER-100299.
